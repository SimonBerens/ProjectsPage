## How it works
Using the [github api](https://developer.github.com/v3/) and the [github colors scheme](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ozh/github-colors/master/colors.json) projects.js automatically generates bootstrap cards based on your repositories and their languages.
## How to use it
Clone the project and change username to your username in the second line of projects.js
